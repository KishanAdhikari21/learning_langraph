# Graph
- consists of **nodes** and **edges**
- kind of like graph in finite automata

# State
- like a dictionary that stores memory, input/output, flags,etc
- central context memory

# Nodes 
- function that does something 
- accept the current state and return either modified state (current) or name of next node to call

# Edges
- decide which node to go to next
- whe to exit the graph
- routing logic for graphs

# End nodes
- signifies the conclusion of the workflow in langgraph

# Tools
- specialized function that utilizes to perform specific task
- like fetching data from API

# conditional edges
- specialized connections that decide the next node to execute based on specific condition or logic

# start node
- virtual entry point in langgraph 
- like start point of racev 

# ReAct (Reason+ Act)
- combines thoughts and action (tools)

# ToolNode
- Node who just run tool

# Runnable
- standardized executable component that performs a specific task within AI workflow

# Messages
## Human messages
- represnent input from a user

## System Message
- used to provide instructions or context to the model

## Function Message
- Represents the result of a function call

## AI message
- represent responses generated by AI models

## Tool Message
- similar to function message but specific to tool use
